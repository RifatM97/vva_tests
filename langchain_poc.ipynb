We investigate the impact of spacecraft \\ncharging on upper thermospheric plasma measurements captured by a 2U CubeSat called Phoenix. Using the Spacecraft \\nPlasma Interactions Software (SPIS), we simulate dayside surface potentials of −\\xa00.6\\xa0V, and nightside potentials of −\\xa00.2\\xa0V. \\nWe also observe this charging mechanism in the distribution function captured by the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer \\n(INMS) on-board Phoenix. Whilst negative charging in the dense ionosphere is known, the diurnal variation in density and \\ntemperature has resulted in dayside potentials that are smaller than at night. We apply charging corrections in accordance \\nwith Liouville’s theorem and employ a least-squares fitting routine to extract the plasma density, bulk speed, and tempera-\\nture. Our routine returns densities that are within an order of magnitude of the benchmarks above, but they carry errors of at \\nleast 20%. All bulk speeds are greater than the expected range of 60–120\\xa0m/s and this could be due to insufficient charging \\ncorrections. Our parameterised ion temperatures are lower than our empirical benchmark but are in-line with other in-situ \\nmeasurements. Temperatures are always improved when spacecraft charging corrections are applied. We mostly attribute \\nthe shortcomings of the findings to the ram-only capture mode of the INMS. Future work will improve the fitting routine \\nand continue to cross-check with other in-flight data.\\nKeywords Spacecraft charging\\xa0· Thermospheric plasmas measurements\\xa0· Ionospheric physics\\xa0· Scientific small satellites\\nAbbreviations\\nU-T  Upper thermosphere\\nSCh  Spacecraft charging\\nINMS  Ion neutral mass spectrometer\\nSPIS  Spacecraft plasma interactions software\\nPIC  Particle in cell\\nHWM  Horizontal wind model1 Introduction\\nThe Upper Thermosphere (U-T) is a region within the Iono-\\nsphere stretching from roughly 300–500\\xa0km. The U-T con-\\nsists of a mixture of ionized and neutral particles, which are \\nmainly Oxygen (O ) and electrons (e ). Atomic and molecular \\nNitrogen (N  & N2), molecular Oxygen (O2) and Nitric Oxide \\n(NO), are also present but in much lower abundancies, and \\ntheir density decrease with increasing altitude [1 ]. Solar pho-\\ntons (hv) are the main source of O  ionisation above 150\\xa0km \\nvia the reaction\\nso O+ is only created in the sunlit side of the U-T. The loss \\nrate of O+ increases by a factor of two during solar maximum \\n[2]. The other ion states are mainly created by collisional-\\nionisation which acts as a loss mechanism for O+ [1]. The \\nenergy provided by hv generally exceeds what is required for \\nionisation, so the released photoelectrons initially have more \\nenergy than their ambient counterparts. This state of the gas \\nis short-lived however, as photoelectrons subsequently lose (1) O+hv→O++e−  * Sachin Reddy \\n sachin.reddy.18@ucl.ac.uk\\n1 Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College \\nLondon, London, England\\n2 Department of\\xa0Physics and\\xa0Astronomy, University College \\nLondon, London, England\\n3 European Space Research and\\xa0Technology Centre (ESTEC), \\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands\\n4 Space Science Center, University of\\xa0New Hampshire, \\nDurham, NH, USA S.\\xa0Reddy et al.\\n1 3\\ntheir energy in elastic collisions with the ambient electrons \\n[2]. This heat transfer is so significant it raises the electron \\ntemperature well above that of the ions. At a mid-latitude \\ndayside orbit during solar minimum, typical temperatures \\nare ~ 1000\\xa0K for the ions and ~ 2400\\xa0K for the electrons [3 , \\n4]. In the same region at night, ion and electron temperatures \\ndrop to ~ 650\\xa0K [4 ]. Ion bulk velocities at a height of 400\\xa0km \\nrange from 10\\xa0m/s at low latitudes and up to 800\\xa0m/s at high \\nlatitudes [5 ]. These drift velocities fluctuate with local time \\nand solar and geomagnetic activity [6 , 7].\\nSpacecraft Charging (SCh) is a process whereby a space -\\ncraft charges to a negative or positive electric potential as a \\nresult of being immersed in a plasma and exposed to radia-\\ntion. Space plasmas consist of free charged particles [8 , 9], \\nwhich accumulate on the surface of the spacecraft as it tran-\\nsits in space. In doing so, a potential difference forms and, \\ndepending on the polarity of the potential, ambient particles \\nare either repelled or attracted to the spacecraft surface [8 , \\n10]. The potential continues to change until all currents flow -\\ning onto and off the spacecraft are equal, in accordance with \\nKirchhoff’s current law. The law states that for every node in \\nequilibrium, the sum of all incoming currents must equal the \\nsum of all outgoing currents [8 ]. In SCh, Kirchhoff’s Law is \\nrepresented by the current balance equation\\nwhere Ie is the incoming current of ambient electrons, Ii is \\nthe incoming current of ambient ions, Is is outgoing cur -\\nrent of secondary electrons, Ib is the outgoing current due \\nto backscattered electron, Iph is the outgoing photo-electron \\ncurrent and, ϕ is the spacecraft electric potential. When equi-\\nlibrium is reached, ϕ is a value that enables all the currents \\nin Eq.\\xa0(2 ) = 0. SCh is also a function of the size and shape of \\nthe spacecraft as well as its materials, capacitance, reflectiv -\\nity and electrical design [8 , 10].\\nIn the mid to low latitudes of the U-T, the plasma regime \\nis denser and cooler than the poles or in the Magnetosphere. \\nElectron temperatures do not exceed 3000\\xa0K and densities \\nare < 3e + 11\\xa0  m−3. At such low energies, the electrons do not \\nhave enough energy to cause any backscattered or secondary \\nelectrons [11]. This means that the ambient electrons domi -\\nnate the current balance Eq.\\xa0(2 ) and the other currents can be \\nlargely neglected. The temperature and density characteris-\\ntics also means that surface potentials are unlikely to exceed \\n−\\xa01\\xa0V [8 ]. That said, any potential, ϕ ≠ 0, can affect on-\\nboard instrumentation, such as ion spectrometers, by shift-\\ning the energy distribution of the particles to be measured \\n[12]. This can lead to inaccuracies when calculating plasma \\nparameters [13, 14], especially if the energy of the species to \\nbe measured is low (< 10\\xa0eV). From a science perspective, \\nSCh can adversely affect the overall mission return. Though \\nstudied extensively for large-class missions, the impact of (2) Ie(/u1D719)−Is(/u1D719)−Ib(/u1D719)−Iph(/u1D719)−Ii(/u1D719)=0SCh on scientific small satellite missions remains virtually \\nunknown.\\nIn this paper, we present a set of diurnal spacecraft poten-\\ntials derived from our spacecraft charging simulations. Then, \\nwe introduce our analysis of in-flight data from the Phoenix \\nINMS, which includes correcting for SCh effects. We go \\non to calculate U-T densities, bulk speeds and temperatures \\nusing a least-squares fitting routine. Finally, we quantify the \\nimpact of SCh on plasma measurements by comparing cor -\\nrected and uncorrected data.\\n2  Instrumentation\\xa0and techniques\\nThe Phoenix is a 2U CubeSat that launched from the Inter -\\nnational Space Station in 2017. Its payload was an Ion \\nNeutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) designed and built \\nby the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, UCL [ 15]. The \\nINMS on Phoenix was operational for ~ 40\\xa0days, returning \\ndata from an orbital inclination of 52° and an altitude of \\n360–380\\xa0km, placing it firmly in the U-T. The CubeSat bus \\nis 10 × 10 × 20\\xa0cm and the INMS has a diameter of 8\\xa0cm and \\na depth of 3.3\\xa0cm. The INMS is a cylindrical electrostatic \\nanalyser that is designed to measure O, N,  N2,  O2 and NO \\nin the U-T [15]. Figure\\xa0 1 shows the exterior of the INMS as \\nwell as an internal schematic.\\nThe INMS can detect both ions and neutrals, although \\nonly the former were captured on Phoenix. Ions enter the \\nINMS through the 5° aperture and travel unaffected through \\nthe ion filter and ionizer chambers. In the analyzer, they are \\nelectrostatically steered by the blue and red semi-circles, \\nknown as hemispheres, which have a voltage applied to \\nthem. To capture the full range of velocities in a particle \\ndistribution, the hemispherical voltage V is logarithmically \\nincreased every 10–20\\xa0ms. As there are 16 energy bins in \\nthe INMS, it takes 160–320\\xa0ms to perform a full sweep.  \\nA single sweep captures the entire O+ particle distribution \\nas well as parts of N+, N2+, NO+ and O2+. The detector is \\na channel electron multiplier, which is optimised for low \\nenergy ions (< 50\\xa0eV). Phoenix operated in a y-thompson \\nspin, which means that it was spinning on its pitch axis. This \\naction means that we do not expect any motion in the yaw \\naxis. The consequence of this is that we cannot measure a \\ncross drift component which we expect to be present. Future \\nwork could take advantage of the spin to measure the verti-\\ncal component of the ion drift.\\n2.1  Spacecraft model\\nTo understand the impact of SCh on plasma measurements, we \\nperform several SCh simulations. To enable this, we needed \\nto first create a model of the spacecraft. The right panel of \\nFig.\\xa0 2 shows the Phoenix and INMS in GMSH [16], a 3D CubeSat measurements of\\xa0thermospheric plasma: spacecraft charging effects on\\xa0a\\xa0plasma analyzer  \\n1 3\\nfinite element generator with meshing capabilities. The model \\nadopts the same dimensions described above and each of the \\nsurfaces (Bus, INMS, Solar Panels, Aperture) are assigned to \\na different material in accordance with Phoenix specifications. \\nThe volume of the simulation is 40 × 40 × 60\\xa0cm, which is large \\nenough to model the plasma dynamics, but small enough to \\navoid incurring a high computational cost.\\n2.2  Spacecraft charging simulations\\nThe Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software (SPIS) [17] is a \\nspecialist software for examining SCh and spacecraft-plasma \\ninteractions. At its core, SPIS iteratively solves the Pois-\\nson equation to determine the electric potential around the \\nspacecraft\\nwhere ϕ is the electric potential, /u1D70C is space charge density \\nand /u1D7160 is the permittivity of free space. SPIS numerically \\nsolves Eq.\\xa0(3 ) in conjunction with a particle-in-cell (PIC) \\ncode to determine the self-consistent motion of the charged (3) ∇2/u1D719=−/u1D70C\\n/u1D7000,plasma particles in the environment of the spacecraft. The \\nPIC code discretises the integration volume, and real par -\\nticles are represented by virtual super-particles which are \\nintegrated according to the equations of motion for charged \\nparticles under action of the Lorentz force [18]. The use of \\nsuper particles has huge computational benefits and we use \\n10–20 particles per cell. Electrons follow a Boltzmann fluid \\napproach and ions adopt the PIC method. Ions must be mod-\\nelled using PIC because of the mesothermal flow ordering:\\nwhere vi is the typical ion velocity, vsc is the spacecraft \\nvelocity and ve is the typical electron velocity. In this regime, \\nions only have access to the ram side of the spacecraft. This \\nflow creates a plasma wake in which there are no ions in \\nthe region immediately downstream of the spacecraft. This \\nsituation requires a kinetic approach for ions which can be \\nachieved with the PIC method. Figure\\xa0 3 illustrates the other \\nsteps in a SCh simulation, where Eq.\\xa0(3 ) is solved in box #2 \\nand the PIC method is applied in box #3.\\nWe obtain the initial plasma temperatures and densities \\nfor box #1 from the Ionospheric Reference International (4) vi<vsc<ve\\nFig. 1  The Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer.

IRI is a global empirical model of the iono-\\nsphere, providing plasma parameters based on specific \\ntimes and locations [3 ]. IRI acts as the primary bench-\\nmark for comparing our findings as we show in the \\n“Results and discussion” section of this paper. Issues with \\nthe onboard computer (OBC) mean that utc, latitude, lon-\\ngitude and altitude values carry large uncertainties and \\nare therefore not usable in the analysis. Subsequently, the \\ndensity and temperature values we use in the simulations \\nare averages. Table\\xa0 1 shows the SPIS simulation param-\\neters for Phoenix and its INMS.\\nThe spacecraft velocity is set to 7.7\\xa0km/s and we cal-\\nculated this with a two-line element method [19 ]. Ions are \\nset to O+ which is the most abundant species in the U-T. \\nLastly, we set up the INMS as a virtual particle detector \\nin SPIS. This function allows us to see the direct impact \\nof spacecraft charging on the O+ distributions in addition \\nto outputting an overall surface potential. It also allows \\nfor a like-for-like comparison between simulations and \\nin-flight data, which is presented in the “Results and dis-\\ncussions” section.2.3  Correction factors\\nThe INMS returns ion counts as a function of sampling \\nenergy. To derive plasma parameters, we first link the \\nhemispherical voltage, V, with the energy of the ions\\nwhere Ei is the transmitted energy, and k  is the proportional-\\nity constant. Velocity is calculated by\\nwhere m is the mass of the particle. Next, counts in each \\nenergy range are converted into phase space density (PSD)\\nwhere N is the ion count from the INMS, ta is the integration \\ntime per energy step (10\\xa0ms for the data analysed) and Ge \\nis the instrument’s geometric factor equal to 6 ×  10–4  cm2 \\nsr eV/eV. A surface potential accelerates (decelerates) ions \\nbefore they reach the INMS, effectively shifting the particle \\ndistribution into a higher (lower) energy bin [ 12]. When ϕsc \\nis known, it can be corrected for by re-shifting the distribu-\\ntion in energy space. A simple way to do this is to re-calcu-\\nlate the energy spectra with ϕsc factored in [14]\\nwhere q is the particle charge, and ϕsc is the spacecraft \\npotential provided by SPIS. Esc is then substituted into \\nEq.\\xa0(6 ) to yield new velocity value, vs. This final step is cru-\\ncial because vs is used in Maxwell–Boltzmann fitting routine \\ndescribed by Eq.\\xa0(10 ) and its corresponding section. The \\ntransformation in Eq.\\xa0(8 ) maps the PSD from the location \\nof the measurement at the INMS to a location outside of the \\nelectrostatic sheath. This is in accordance with Liouville’s \\ntheorem which states that PSD is conserved along individual \\nparticle trajectories in phase space [ 14]. Liouville’s theo -\\nrem only holds if collisions are negligible. The collisional \\nmean-free path of particles in the U-T is large ~ 100\\xa0m [ 20], \\nwhereas we calculate the Debye length to be very small λD \\n~ 1\\xa0cm. This means Liouville’s theorem can be applied, but \\nonly at lengths up to the size of the electrostatic sheath [14], \\nwhich is generally a few Debye lengths in size.(5) Ei=kV\\n(6) vi=/uni221A.s2\\n2Ei\\nm\\n(7)f(v)=2N\\ntav4\\niGe\\n(8) Esc=Ei+q/u1D719sc\\nFig. 3  A simplified overview of how SPIS works.

In the dayside, the spacecraft surface potentials \\nreach −\\xa00.64\\xa0V, whereas at night they are −\\xa00.19\\xa0V. Pre-\\nvious work has theorised and observed that spacecraft \\npotentials may be negative both in sunlight and eclipse \\nif the plasma density is sufficiently high [21– 23]; how -\\never, our work goes further by observing a more nega-\\ntive potential in the dayside. This is part explained by the \\nthree-fold increase in the electron temperature during the \\nday [3 , 4, 8], and the knowledge that spacecraft charging \\nis directly proportional to the electron temperature [8 , 10]. \\nThe other reason is that the plasma density is 42% higher \\nduring the day (see Table\\xa0 1), which means a significantly \\nhigher ambient electron current in Eq.\\xa0(2 ). Therefore, a \\ngreater negative potential is required for the current bal-\\nance to equal 0. As part of our analysis, we run several \\nsimulations with the sun in different positions with respect \\nto the spacecraft. Whilst in the dayside, Phoenix expe-\\nriences varying levels of sunlight on the surface, which \\nmeans that the outward photoemission current varies. At \\na minimum,\\xa0only the ram (or rear) direction is exposed to \\nsunlight, which represents 0.1  m2 or 10% of the overall \\nsurface. At a maximum, the ram (or rear) and two sides are \\nin sunlight, which represents 0.5  m2 or 50% of the overall \\nsurface. Despite this large variation, the surface potential only decreases by 0.03\\xa0eV from minimum to maximum, \\nwhich is < 5% of the overall dayside potential. This is fur -\\nther evidence that the photoelectron current is negligible, \\nas reported by Hastings [11].\\nThe right panel of Fig.\\xa0 4 shows a magnification of the \\nINMS and its aperture, allowing for a closer examination \\nof the sheath thickness. The figure shows that the sheath is \\napproximately 3 × greater during the day than it is at night. \\nLiouville’s theorem is only expected to hold at distances \\nequivalent to the electrostatic sheath [14], therefore any ions \\nbeyond this point cannot be accurately shifted in phase space \\naccording to Eq.\\xa0(8 ). This means that they must be removed \\nfrom the analysis. Lastly, Fig.\\xa0 4 also shows that ambient \\nions travel through a negative potential [qV]  drop on their \\ntrajectory to the aperture of the INMS. In doing so, they gain \\nkinetic energy [E] → [E + qV] and the distribution shifts into \\na higher energy bin. Because V  is smaller at night so too is \\nthe energy shift.\\n3.2  Inflight data\\nIn keeping with the SPIS simulations, we also split the in-\\nflight data based on diurnality. Owing to the issues with the \\nOBC, we use the surface thermal monitors, which measure \\nthe spacecraft temperature at the time the INMS captures \\nions, to determine day and night. Figure\\xa0 5 shows the space-\\ncraft surface temperatures across seven selected dates. Those \\ncaptured in May 2018 are designated as being in the dayside, \\nwhereas those in June are in the nightside (Fig.\\xa0\\xa0 4).\\nFig. 4  SPIS simulations of Phoenix at day and night. Left: During the \\nday potentials reach −0.64\\xa0V, but during the night they do not exceed \\n−0.2\\xa0 V. The white arrow indicates the flight direction. Right: Ions travel through the potential drop before reaching the aperture of the \\ninstrument, gaining kinetic energy as they do S.\\xa0Reddy et al.\\n1 3\\nThe dayside temperature has a wider range because one \\nside of the spacecraft is sunlit, whilst the other is in the \\nshade, even though the whole spacecraft remains in the \\ndayside. Figure\\xa0 6 shows the number of counts per second \\ncaptured on these dates as a function of energy. A full sweep \\nconsists of 16 bins, and therefore takes 160-320\\xa0ms.\\nThe dates above the blue line are in the dayside and those \\nbelow are in the nightside. The first observation is that the \\ndayside count rates are considerably higher than the night-\\nside count rates. This suggests that the O+ density is greater \\nduring the day than it is at night, which is in line with exist-\\ning literature, as discussed in the “Introduction” [1 , 24]. Sec-\\nondly, in the nightside dates around 9\\xa0eV, there is a second \\ncluster of count rates that are separate from the others. We \\nhypothesise that this is a second species and for the given \\nenergy range, it could be NO+ or N2+. The former is more \\nlikely, but neither were expected at this altitude. It is pos-\\nsible that a second species is also present in the dayside, but \\nit is less obvious because the corresponding energy range is covered by the increased O+ signal. SCh could also shift it \\nbeyond the range of the INMS (> 12\\xa0eV), although our SPIS \\nsimulations do not confirm this. The final observation from \\nFig.\\xa06 is the location of the highest count rates with respect \\nto energy. In all the dayside values the highest (peak) count \\nrates are in the 5.3\\xa0eV energy bin, whereas at night, they \\npeak at either 4.3\\xa0eV or 4.8\\xa0eV, resulting in a 1\\xa0eV range. To \\nunderstand where we expect the O+ peak to be, we adopt a \\nmodified kinetic equation which incorporates bulk speed and \\nspacecraft charging [25]\\nwhere usc is the spacecraft velocity and uw is the ion bulk \\nspeed. Particles which travel in the opposite direction to the \\nspacecraft are classified as a headwind and usc + uw applies. \\nThose which travel in the same direction as the spacecraft \\nare termed a tailwind and usc—uw applies. Our analysis places \\nthe uw term at between 60 and 120\\xa0m/s, which is enough \\nto shift the peak energy. This range was calculated using \\nthe Horizonal Wind Model (HWM) which is an empirical \\nand in-situ U-T model that computes the horizontal wind \\nvector fields from sea level to around 450\\xa0km [ 26, 27]. In \\nthe mid-low latitudes, tidal forcing is more dominant than \\nthe electrodynamical forces. As the neutral to ion ratio is \\nroughly 1000:1 at Phoenix’s operational altitudes, the ions \\ncollide and thermalise with the neutral particles, leading to \\napproximately equal flow velocities. Therefore, we use the \\nHWM as an indicator for the ion drifts which we measure \\nwith the INMS. To quantify the contributions to the 1\\xa0eV \\nvariation, we first assume there is no spacecraft potential \\nϕsc= 0. We then factor in the spacecraft velocity and apply \\n120\\xa0m/s to Eq.\\xa0(9 ). This results in O + energies of 5.08\\xa0eV \\n(headwind) and 4.78\\xa0eV (tailwind). Applying the nightside \\npotential of −\\xa00.2\\xa0V shifts these energies to 5.28\\xa0eV and \\n4.98\\xa0eV. For the dayside, the shifted values are 5.74\\xa0eV and (9) E=1\\n2m/parenleft.s1usc±uw/parenright.s12+q/u1D719sc\\nFig. 5  Surface thermal monitor data across the seven dates that make \\nup the dayside and nightside split. “t1” and “t2” are bus sensors, and \\nthe sensor labelled as “inms” is within the INMS housing. Note the \\nspecific time is not known owing to issues with the OBC\\nFig. 6  Heatmap of INMS count \\nrates across seven dates.

Therefore, the 1\\xa0eV observed could be caused by a \\ndayside potential with a strong headwind, or by a nightside \\npotential with a strong tailwind. Unfortunately, issues with \\nthe OBC means we cannot verify this, but future work will \\naim to do so.\\nThe spinning of the spacecraft could also explain the \\nvariance. The simulations neglect the spinning of the space -\\ncraft about its pitch axis, known as a y-Thompson spin. This \\nspin can decrease the potential at the spacecraft centre, and \\nincrease it at the extremities [28], which is the location of the \\nINMS. In that case, the energy shift could be slightly greater \\nthan the simulations suggest.\\nLastly, we neglect the effect of the magnetic field. \\nAlthough the electron gyro-radius is comparable to the \\nCubeSat  ~ 3\\xa0cm to 10\\xa0cm, SPIS simulations including a real -\\nistic value of the magnetic field reveal that it has little effect \\non the surface potential. We found that the spacecraft poten-\\ntials increase slightly from −\\xa00.669\\xa0V to −\\xa00.665\\xa0V in pres-\\nence of a magnetic field, and an increase has been reported \\nin previous studies [29– 31]. That said, such an increase does \\nnot noticeably affect the derivation of the ion moments.\\n3.3  Correcting for\\xa0spacecraft charging\\nOnce the spacecraft potential is known, the distribution can \\nbe corrected with the following procedure. First, the ion \\ncounts are converted to phase space density with Eq.\\xa0(7 ). \\nSCh corrections are applied with Eq.\\xa0(8 ) and the particle dis-\\ntribution is shifted in accordance with Liouville’s theorem. \\nThe left panel of Fig.\\xa0 7 illustrates the INMS data with and \\nwithout SCh corrections, during day and night. Each curve \\nis an aggregation of the different dates, so the dayside curve \\nconsists of four dates and the nightside of 3. The darker line \\nin the middle of the aggregated data is the median value for \\neach energy, and the shaded regions represents a confidence interval of 90%. The confidence is automatically calculated \\nby the plotting routine based on the aggregated data. Confi-\\ndence appears to decrease in higher energy ranges, but this \\nis a feature of logarithmic statistics in higher energy ranges.\\nThe right panel also shows the distribution during the day \\nand night, but this is a simulated output from SPIS using \\nthe virtual particle detector function. The vertical axis has \\nbeen removed because it is in arbitrary units. The right panel \\nrepresents the effects in a slightly different way to the left. \\nInstead of viewing a distribution as corrected  or uncor -\\nrected, SPIS calculates a distribution at the instrument and \\nat the simulation boundary. Therefore, it shows what the \\ndistribution would be without the presence of SCh. Correc-\\ntion yes = Outside Sheath and correction no = INMS.\\nThe dayside shift is greater than the nightside shift in both \\nthe INMS data and the simulation. This is because SCh is \\ngreater during the day (see Fig.\\xa0 4), so the peak shifts into \\na higher energy bin [32]. The vertical black dotted line at \\n4.9\\xa0eV in the right panel of Fig.\\xa0 7 is the peak energy of \\nO + according to Eq.\\xa0(9) with uw = 0. As seen, the outside \\nsheath peak and dayside / nightside O+ positions match \\nup exactly. There is no black dotted line in the left panel \\nbecause the INMS data also include a wind-vector and \\ninstrument noise. As a result, we expect some misalignment \\nbetween the dayside and nightside data; however, this mis-\\nalignment is lessened after SCh corrections. At this stage, \\nthe contribution of the wind vector cannot be accurately \\nfactored in because it can contribute to a higher and lower \\nenergy shift (see Eq.\\xa0(9 )).\\n3.4  Fitting routine\\nA key science objective for Phoenix is to derive plasma \\nparameters from the U-T, which includes the den-\\nsity, bulk speed and temperature. To do this, we apply a \\nFig. 7  Left: INMS observations split into dayside (purple) and night-\\nside (orange) with (solid) and without (dotted) SCh corrections.

The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is spe -\\ncifically designed to solve non-linear curve fitting problems \\n[33, 34]. It does this by minimising the sum of the squares \\nof the residuals between a model function and a set of data (10) f/parenleft.s1vs/parenright.s1=n/parenleft.s3\\nm\\n2/u1D70BKbT/parenright.s33∕2\\nexp/parenleft.s4\\n−m/parenleft.s1vs−v0/parenright.s12\\n2KbT/parenright.s4points which are the Maxwellian and INMS data, respec-\\ntively. We use the LMFIT module for Python to achieve \\nthe least-squares fit [35]. The method requires free param-\\neters to optimise the fit, which we assign to n , v0 and T.  The \\nquality of the fit, and therefore the credibility of the plasma \\nparameters, is quantitatively assessed with the reduced chi \\nsquared χ2\\nv metric\\nwhere ri is the residual error after the least-squares optimisa-\\ntion, N is the number of data points, and Nv is the number of \\nvariable parameters.

However, on \\nthe 25th, the INMS captures some additional points in the \\n8–10\\xa0eV region, which could be the presence of either NO+ \\nor N2+. At present, this cannot be investigated further owing \\nto the small number of ion counts. Pitch corresponds to the \\nspacecraft pitch angle when the distribution was captured.\\nA pitch = 0  indicates the Phoenix is facing the horizon, \\npitch  < 0 = downward pointing  and, pitch  > 0 = upward point-\\ning. All four dates capture peak distribution whilst facing \\ndownward, which could suggest a sky-pointing vertical wind \\ncomponent. All dayside densities align with those reported \\nby Huba and IRI [3 , 24], and the error in the values varies \\nfrom 20 to 26% (See Table\\xa0 3). Our HWM analysis reveals \\nthat bulk speeds are between 60 and 120\\xa0m/s, and the param-\\neterised v0 is greater than this across all dates. The fit error \\nin these estimates however is excellent at ±  < 1%.\\nTemperatures across all four dates are lower than \\nthe ~ 1000\\xa0K reported by Otsuka and IRI [3 , 4]. The tem-\\nperature error estimation is  ±  < 14% for all dates. Figure\\xa0 9 applies the same fitting routine but to the three nightside \\ndates.\\nFirstly, the quality of the fits is generally poorer across \\nthe nightside dates as indicated by Table\\xa0 3. It is also clear \\nthat the consistency and distribution of points differs from \\nthe dayside distributions. The 20th of June reveals a distribu -\\ntion that is increasingly non-Maxwellian in the high-energy \\ntail (above 6\\xa0eV). This date exhibits the characteristics of a \\nsuprathermal  tail and therefore might be better described \\nby a kappa distribution [ 36]. Kappa distributions have been \\napplied to a wide range of plasma environments, including \\nFig. 9  Maxwell–Boltzmann least squares fitting routine applied to nightside INMS dataTable 3  Density errors and reduced chi squared values\\xa0from the Max-\\nwell–Boltzmann fitting routine\\nDate Location Density Error rχ2\\n2018-05-19 Dayside 4.2 e + 11  ± 24% 0.065\\n2018-05-21 Dayside 4.9 e + 11  ± 21% 0.043\\n2018-05-22 Dayside 5.5 e + 11  ± 20% 0.048\\n2018-05-25 Dayside 4.5 e + 11  ± 26% 0.075\\n2018-06-20 Nightside 4.2 e + 10  ± 35% 0.084\\n2018-06-26 Nightside 4.9 e + 10  ± 37% 0.082\\n2018-06-28 Nightside 1.8 e + 10  ± 45% 0.072 S.\\xa0Reddy et al.\\n1 3\\nthe solar wind and magnetosphere [37], because they often \\nbetter represent the collisionless nature of space plasmas \\n[38].

It is also \\npossible that the points around the 8–10\\xa0eV represent an \\nadditional species. Similarly to the dayside two of the three \\ndates exhibit a sky pointing component to the bulk speed \\nas the spacecraft pitch angle is < 0. Like the dayside data, \\nall densities are within an order of magnitude of the bench-\\nmark data but carry lower confidence values (see Table\\xa0 3). \\nNightside bulk speed confidence is also very high at ±  < 1%. Lastly, like the dayside data, all temperatures are below the \\nexpected range outlined in Table\\xa0 1 and the routine estimates \\nall errors to be < 25%. The lower confidence in the parame-\\nterised density and temperature likely results from the lower \\nnumber of points, N, to fit from.\\nThe final stage is to quantify the impact of SCh on the fit-\\nting routine.

Future work will aim to compare with specific dates from IRICubeSat measurements of\\xa0thermospheric plasma: spacecraft charging effects on\\xa0a\\xa0plasma analyzer  \\n1 3\\ntemperature is informed by [3 –5, 24], and bulk speeds from \\nour own HWM analysis and [5 ].\\nThe dayside densities are higher than expected and the \\ndeviation increases with corrections. The same pattern exists \\nin the nightside, but the parameterised density is lower to \\nstart with, so the correction improves the measurement. \\nTable\\xa0 3 shows that some of the density values carry moder -\\nate error values (> 40%), so it is possible that the values are \\nmuch closer (or even further) to the benchmark. With SCh \\ncorrections, all the bulk speeds are closer to the expected \\nrange of 60–120\\xa0m/s. One explanation could be that the \\nsurface potential on Phoenix was greater than in the SPIS \\nsimulations. Knudsen et\\xa0al. [39] apply a −\\xa01\\xa0V charging \\ncorrection to the Electric Field Instrument (EFI) payload \\non SWARM, which operates ~ 80\\xa0km higher than Phoenix \\nat ~ 460\\xa0km and is in a near-polar orbit. Our own analysis of \\nthe SWARM EFI data reveals that the surface potentials can \\nreach up to −\\xa02\\xa0V. Applying a −\\xa01\\xa0V correction to the Phoe-\\nnix data results in negative bulk speeds, which suggests the \\ncorrection factor is too high. Appling a −\\xa00.75\\xa0V correction \\nresults in bulk speeds that are 125\\xa0m/s, 50\\xa0m/s and 98\\xa0m/s \\nfor the 19th, 21st and 22nd of May respectively, which is in \\nbetter agreement with our HWM analysis. Increasing the \\ncharging correction has no impact on the density or tem-\\nperature. All temperatures are also closer to the benchmark \\nwhen charging corrections are applied, but the routine seems \\nto underestimate across all dates. However, when Phoenix \\ntemperatures are compared with EFI data from SWARM, \\nit reveals that temperatures may be lower than the values \\nprovided by IRI (Fig.\\xa0 11).\\nWhen both missions are in the same hemisphere, the com-\\nparison is more reliable, because the plasma conditions are \\nmore similar for both missions. As seen, the temperatures \\non the 19th, 22nd\\xa0and 25th are similar across both missions \\nand all\\xa0are below the 1000\\xa0K low benchmark provided by \\nIRI. This will be explored further when data from the SOAR \\nCubeSat mission becomes available.One of the fundamental limitations of using the INMS \\nto derive plasma parameters is its ram-only capture mode, \\nwhich means that the data is\\xa0only recorded in one dimen-\\nsion. For comparison, the Electron Analyser System (EAS) \\non Solar Orbiter samples the full three-dimensional velocity \\nspace [40]. This increased dimensionality and a larger effec-\\ntive area—which results in better statistics—equates to more \\naccurate fitting results. There is however a trade-off in terms \\nof increased computational and mathematical complexity. \\nA possible solution could be to utilise the Phoenix’s rota-\\ntion, or y-Thompson spin, to increase the dimensionality. A \\nparallel angle could be selected to represent data captured \\nat a pitch angle of 0° and an oblique angle could be used \\nfor data at every other angle [41]. Although this approach \\nwill still result in a smaller coverage of velocity space than \\nin the full 3D geometry, it would double the dimensional-\\nity and we expect that this would improve the accuracy of \\nour fitted parameters. That said, more dimensions equates to \\nlonger sampling time and, depending on the plasma scales, \\nthis could actually lead to less accurate fitting. This method \\nis currently being explored and may feature in future works.\\nAnother influence on the parameters is whether to fit in \\nlinear or logarithmic space. Our analysis reveals that the for -\\nmer improves the bulk speeds with respect to the benchmark, \\nwhereas the latter improves the densities and temperatures. \\nWe chose to fit in log space because it better represents the \\nphase space density which is distributed over multiple orders \\nof magnitude. Wellbrock et\\xa0al. [38] present an alternative \\nmethod to derive the density of negative ions (at Titan) by \\ndividing the counts by the spacecraft velocity and instru-\\nment area [42]\\nwhere n is the ion density, c  is the number of counts, A  is the \\neffective area of the instrument, /u1D6DC is the detector efficiency, \\nand usc is the spacecraft velocity. In a first attempt to apply \\nWellbrock’s method, we calculate densities in the range of \\n1e + 9\\xa0  m−3, which are lower than we predicted. We anticipate \\nthat this could be due to inaccurate A  or /u1D6DC values and this is \\ncurrently under investigation.\\n4  Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we present a method for quantifying the \\nimpact of spacecraft charging on thermospheric plasma \\nmeasurements. We observe that a 2U CubeSat in the \\nupper thermosphere charges to a negative surface poten-\\ntial in\\xa0both the dayside and nightside. Although negative \\nsurface potentials in the ionosphere have been reported \\nbefore, we simulate dayside potentials which are more \\nnegative than those in the nightside. This is counter to (12)n=c\\nA/u1D716usc\\nFig. 11  Comparison between SWARM and Phoenix, and whether \\nthey are in the same or opposite hemisphere S.\\xa0Reddy et al.\\n1 3\\nother charging mechanisms, whereby the presence of a \\nphotoelectric current leads to a positive surface poten-\\ntial in the dayside. We both simulate this condition and \\nobserve it with in-flight data, providing a strong case for \\nthe existence of diurnally invariant negative charging. The \\nreason for this is a three-fold increase in electron tem-\\nperatures and a > 40% increase in densities during the day \\nwhen compared to the night. All of which means a greater \\nsurface potential is required to balance the increased ambi-\\nent electron current.\\nWe factor out the effects of spacecraft charging by cor -\\nrecting the phase-space density for the spacecraft electric \\npotential. To do this, we assume that phase-space diffusion \\nis not occurring within the electrostatic sheath and there-\\nfore phase space is conserved in accordance with Liou-\\nville’s theorem. We neglect ions whose trajectory starts \\nbeyond the sheath. A Levenberg–Marquardt least squares \\nfitting routine is employed to derive the plasma param-\\neters. Fitted densities are within an order of magnitude \\nof the expected benchmark, day: 1e  + 11\\xa0 m−3 and night: \\n7e + 10\\xa0 m−3 but all carry errors of at least 20%. All the \\nparameterised bulk speeds are above the expected range of \\n60–120\\xa0m/s, but are closer to this benchmark with correc-\\ntions applied. It is possible that the surface potentials are \\nmore negative than simulated, which would lead to bulk \\nspeeds that are closer to the IRI benchmark. Temperatures \\nare below the empirical model but are in-line with in-situ \\ndata from SWARM. All temperatures are improved with \\ncharging factored in. Density is primarily compared with \\nthe International Reference Ionosphere model, tempera-\\nture with IRI plus SWARM data, and bulk speeds with \\nthe Horizontal Wind Model. One of the key limitations \\nof the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer is its ram-only cap-\\nture mode and we are working on methods to improve its \\ndimensionality.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first-time ion \\nmoments have been successfully derived with a CubeSat-\\nbased spectrometer. At the time of writing, a new Cube-\\nSat mission called SOAR has launched and is currently in \\nthe commissioning phase. SOAR carries the same INMS \\nas Phoenix, but with an additional time-of-flight capability. \\nSOAR will be inserted into the same orbit\\xa0as Phoenix so it \\nprovides an excellent opportunity to further validate the find -\\nings and to continue the study of the upper thermosphere.\\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Jyn-Ching Juang, \\nSantosh Bhattarai, Richard Haythornthwaite, Jordan Vannitsen and the \\nSpacecraft Charging Working Group at MSSL, UCL.\\nAuthor contributions DK conceived the initial study.
